# Contributing

Found a typo in the documentation or interested in [fixing a bug](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

For help with using the theme or general Jekyll support questions, please use the [Jekyll Talk forums](https://talk.jekyllrb.com/).

Minimal Mistakes has been designed as a base for you to customize and fit your 
site's unique needs. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or 
submitting pull requests. If it's not something that most people will use, I 
probably won't consider it. When in doubt ask.

This goes for author sidebar links and "share button" additions -- I have no 
intention of merging in every possibly option, the essentials are there to get 
you started :smile:.

## Pull Requests

When submitting a pull request:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Create a branch off of `master` and give it a meaningful name (e.g. 
   `my-awesome-new-feature`) and describe the feature or fix.
3. Open a pull request on GitHub.
